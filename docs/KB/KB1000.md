# Django 2.0 and newer are not supported

## Synopsis

When using Django 2.0 or newer the developer may face *Apps are not loaded yet* error when running command ```python -m manage runserver```.

## Actions

### Downgrade the Django Framework below 2.0
To downgrade Django Framework to a version below 2.0 edit your ```requirements.txt``` file with following:
```text
django<2.0,>1.11
```
to ensure the newest 1.x supported distribution of Django.

It is important to remember, that some functions may have to be ported to the 1.11+ version, i.e.
```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('foo/', bar, name="baz"),
]
```
may not be supported.
